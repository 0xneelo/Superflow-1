*   **Concept:** Arbitrage - Exploiting price differences.
    *   *(General finance textbooks cover this; specific arbitrage types like latency or MEV-related arbitrage are more specialized - see DeFi section)*.

## 2. Game Theory & Strategic Behavior

    *   *(Covered in standard microeconomics and game theory textbooks)*.
*   **Concept:** Strategic Dominance - Where one strategy consistently yields better outcomes regardless of opponents' actions.
    *   *(Covered in standard game theory textbooks)*.

## 3. Derivatives & Financial Engineering

    *   **Source:** Black, F., & Scholes, M. (1973). "The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities." *Journal of Political Economy*, 81(3), 637–654.

## 4. Cryptocurrency/DeFi Specific Concepts

*   **Concept:** MEV (Maximum/Miner Extractable Value) - Value extracted by ordering or inserting transactions, relevant to sophisticated actors' advantages.
    *   **Source:** Daian, P., et al. (2019). "Flash Boys 2.0: Frontrunning, Transaction Reordering, and Consensus Instability in Decentralized Exchanges." *arXiv preprint arXiv:1904.05234*. (Seminal paper identifying MEV on DEXs).

    *   *(Whitepapers and documentation for specific AMM protocols are key sources)*.
*   **Concept:** Isolated Spot Market Launches - Specific dynamics of new token launches on DEXs, often with low initial liquidity.
    *   *(This is a relatively niche area; requires searching recent conference proceedings (e.g., Financial Cryptography), DeFi research blogs (e.g., Paradigm, a16z crypto), or potentially new working papers)*.
*   **Concept:** Symmio Protocol - The specific OTC derivatives protocol mentioned.
    *   **Source:** Symmio Documentation & Whitepaper: [https://docs.symm.io/](https://docs.symm.io/) (Primary source for protocol mechanics).
*   **Concept:** Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) - Influence dynamics in crypto markets.
    *   *(Research in social network analysis, information diffusion, and potentially marketing journals applied to crypto contexts might be relevant. Often qualitative or empirical)*.

## 5. Behavioral Finance

*   **Concept:** FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) - Irrational buying behavior driven by observing others' gains.
    *   **Source:** Shiller, R. J. (2015). *Irrational Exuberance* (3rd ed.). Princeton University Press. (Discusses speculative bubbles and market psychology).
    *   *(General concept, often discussed in behavioral economics/finance literature regarding herd behavior)*.

    *   **Source:** Kahneman, D. (2011). *Thinking, Fast and Slow*. Farrar, Straus and Giroux.
    *   **Source:** Thaler, R. H. (2015). *Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics*. W. W. Norton & Company.

## 6. Specific Examples/Claims

*   **Claim:** Fantom rebranding to Sonic, TVL surge.
    *   **Source:** Official Fantom Foundation announcements/blog posts (Search around Oct-Nov 2023). Example: [https://fantom.foundation/blog/sonic-propelling-fantom-new-era/](https://fantom.foundation/blog/sonic-propelling-fantom-new-era/)
    *   **Source:** Crypto news outlets (e.g., CoinDesk, The Block, CoinTelegraph) covering the announcement.
    *   **Source:** DeFiLlama ([https://defillama.com/chain/Fantom](https://defillama.com/chain/Fantom)) for historical TVL data (Note: The whitepaper's claim of Jan 2025 and \$1Bn TVL needs verification against actual historical data post-announcement/transition; the provided date seems predictive/incorrect).

*Disclaimer: This list is a starting point. A formal academic whitepaper requires precise citations linked directly to specific claims within the text and thorough verification of all sources and data.*
